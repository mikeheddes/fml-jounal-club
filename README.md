# Fundamental Machine Learning Journal Club ðŸ¤–ðŸ“–

This is the home page for the Journal Club on Fundamental Machine Learning research. We meet weekly for 1 hour to discuss a paper we have decided to read the meeting before. Each meeting has a lead who will take initiative at going over the paper and starts the discussion. It is supposed to be a casual setting where machine learning researchers gather to discuss their outlook on the field.

## Topics

In order to be interesting for a diverse set of machine learning researchers we focus on fundamental research which could touch on many subfields and applications of machine learning. Examples of topics include but are not limited to:

- Cognitive abilities of computers
- Explainability
- Learning techniques
- Neural Network architecteurs
- Challenges in machine learning
- Data efficiency

## Paper selection process

If you know of an interesting and relevant paper you can suggest it in [our discussion](https://github.com/mikeheddes/fundamental-ai-jounal-club/discussions/2). This is also where you can vote on suggested papers such that we get an idea of which papers have the highest interest.
