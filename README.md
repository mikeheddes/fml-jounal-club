# Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Journal Club ðŸ¤–ðŸ“–

This is the home page for the Journal Club on Fundamental Artificial Intelligence research. We meet bi-weekly for 1.5 hours to discuss a paper we have decided to read the meeting before. Each meeting has a lead who will take initiative at going over the paper and starts the discussion.
