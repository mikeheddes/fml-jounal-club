# Fundamental Machine Learning Journal Club ðŸ¤–ðŸ“–

This is the home page for the Journal Club on Fundamental Machine Learning research at UC Irvine. We meet weekly for 1 hour to discuss a paper we have decided to read the meeting before. Each meeting has a lead who will take initiative at going over the paper and starts the discussion. It is supposed to be a casual setting where Machine Learning researchers gather to discuss their outlook on the field.

## Location and time

We meet every week on **Wednesday at 1 PM** in **DBH 3098** for **1 hour**.<br/>
Every UC Irvine student is welcome to join, no invitation needed.

## Topics

We focus on fundamental research in order to be interesting for a diverse set of researchers across many subfields and applications of Machine Learning. Examples of topics include, but are not limited to:

- Cognitive abilities of computers
- Explainability
- Learning techniques
- Neural Network architecteurs
- Catastrophic forgetting
- Meta-Learning
- Data efficiency
- Challenges in Machine Learning
