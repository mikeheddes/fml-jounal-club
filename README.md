# Fundamental Machine Learning Journal Club ðŸ¤–ðŸ“–

This is the home page for the Journal Club on Fundamental Machine Learning research at UC Irvine. We meet weekly for 1 hour to discuss a paper we have decided to read the meeting before. Each meeting has a lead who will take initiative at going over the paper and starts the discussion. It is supposed to be a casual setting where Machine Learning researchers gather to discuss their outlook on the field. We also encourage collaboration on releated research problems.

If you are interested in joining, send an email to [mheddes@uci.edu](mailto:mheddes@uci.edu) or show up to one of our meetings.

## Location and time

We meet every week on **Wednesday at 1 PM** in **DBH 4013** for **1 hour**.<br/>
Every UC Irvine student is welcome to join, no invitation needed.

## Topics

We focus on fundamental research in order to be interesting for a diverse set of researchers across many subfields and applications of Machine Learning. Examples of topics include, but are not limited to:

- Cognitive abilities of computers
- The binding problem
- Explainability
- Learning algorithms
- Neural Network architecteurs
- Catastrophic forgetting
- Meta-Learning
- Data efficiency
- Challenges in Machine Learning
